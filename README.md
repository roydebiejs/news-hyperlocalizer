# Project Name

Brief description of your project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Docker and Docker Compose on your machine.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get your copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes.

### Installation

To set up your development environment:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://yourrepositoryurl.git
   cd your-project-directory
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

This will build the Docker image if it's not already built and start the container. The Vite development server will be accessible at http://localhost:5173, and it will reflect changes made to your local files in real time.

### Usage

After running the commands above, you can start developing your application. The server will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Additional Notes

    - If you experience any problems, please make sure Docker is running on your machine.
    - Ensure that no other services are running on port 5173 to avoid port conflicts.
